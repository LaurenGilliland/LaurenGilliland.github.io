Hi! My name is Lauren Gilliland. I was born and raised in Hawaii and currently attend UH Manoa. I am studying for a B.S. in Business Marketing and MIS. I highly value my free time as I do not have much of it and like to go hiking or traveling when I get the chance to do so. 

I would say that I have a moderate grasp of computer science knowledge as I currently work as a TA for ICS101. Hopefully the knowledge I have picked up from my job will assist me with completing ITM352 with a good grade!

In regard to why I chose MIS as my major, I was originally studying for a minor in CS however I didn't like how coding heavy the track was. I also realized that I didn't want to be in a career where coding was my main job, I wanted to explore other areas of business and web development insted. I ended up talking to one of my coworkers and he suggested that I look in to MIS as it is more of a mix between computer science and business.
