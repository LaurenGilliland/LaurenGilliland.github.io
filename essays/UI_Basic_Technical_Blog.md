WOD1: 17 min
This was the only WOD that I DNF’d. I only read the instructions that told me how to set up for the WOD before I started timing myself. All of the instructions past “start your timer” were new to me when I started recording so I ended up running out of time. The second time I tried the WOD I was slower but I was able to finish within the time limit. In order to improve I made sure that I read all of the instructions as well as studied my notes from the modules that related to the WOD before I started recording. 

WOD2: 9:40 min
This time I read the instructions all the way through, studied my notes, and studied related articles on W3schools. While my first attempt was within the time frame there were a few kinks where I had to pause to find an error in my code and fix it. Because I didn’t like how smooth this first recording was I decided to do it over so it could flow better. I highly recommend reading up on the instructions and finding the coding answers in your notes or on W3schools before trying the WOD to save time and prevent yourself from having to repeat filming over and over again. 

WOD3: 8:50 min
For this WOD I practiced what I had learned in previous WODs. The only issue is that I did notice an error in my code from a previous WOD which took me a while to identify and fix. I also spent a lot of time trying to format the page to make it look better. I did happen to watch a part of the YouTube tutorial that I was stuck on which helped me finish the WOD. I wasn’t completely satisfied with the flow of my final recording but I was tired of sitting there for so long and completing WOD after WOD so I called it a day.
