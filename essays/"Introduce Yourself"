Hi! My name is Lauren Gilliland. I was born and raised in Hawaii and currently attend UH Manoa. I am studying for a B.S. in Business Marketing and MIS. I highly value my free time as I do not have much of it and like to go hiking or traveling when I get the chance to do so. 

I would say that I have a moderate grasp of computer science knowledge as I currently work as a TA for ICS101. Hopefully the knowledge I have picked up from my job will assist me with completing ITM352 with a good grade!
